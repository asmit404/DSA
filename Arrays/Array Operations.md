## Array Operations

Arrays are fundamental data structures that store a collection of elements of the same data type. Various operations can be performed on arrays, allowing you to manage and manipulate their elements.

### Basic Operations

* **Traversal:** Iterating through each element of the array, typically in a sequential order (start to finish or vice versa).
* **Access:** Retrieving the value of an element at a specific index (position) within the array.
* **Search:** Finding the index or location of a specific element within the array.
* **Insertion:** Adding a new element to the array at a specific position.
* **Deletion:** Removing an element from the array at a specific position.
* **Update:** Modifying the value of an element at a specific index.

### More Advanced Operations

* **Sorting:** Arranging the elements of the array in a particular order (ascending, descending, based on custom criteria).
* **Merging:** Combining two or more sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
* **Splitting:** Dividing an array into multiple sub-arrays based on certain criteria.
* **Resizing:** Changing the size of the array to accommodate more or fewer elements (may not be supported in all languages).
* **Reversing:** Reversing the order of elements in the array (placing the last element first, and so on).
* **Finding Minimum/Maximum:** Identifying the element with the smallest or largest value in the array.

### Additional Operations

* **Shifting:** Moving elements within the array by a certain number of positions.
* **Rotating:** Circularly shifting the elements of the array by a specified number of positions.
* **Filling:** Assigning a specific value to all elements in the array.
* **Searching for specific patterns:** Finding subsequences or specific arrangements of elements within the array.

The availability and implementation of specific operations will depend on the programming language and data structure library you're using.
